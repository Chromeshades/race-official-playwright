R.A.C.E Playwright End-to-End Testing
=========================================

This repository contains Playwright end-to-end (E2E) tests for the R.A.C.E website which will eventually become <https://race.social>). These tests are designed to ensure the core functionality and user experience of the website remain intact throughout development.

Key Features
------------

-   **Page Object Model:** Organizes tests for better maintainability and readability.
-   **Fixtures:** Sets up consistent test data and environments.
-   **TypeScript:** Provides type safety and improved code structure.
-   **GitHub Actions:** Automates test execution on every code change.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Chromeshades/race-official-playwright.git
    cd race-official-playwright
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    npm install
    npx playwright install chromium #  This downloads the Chromium browser needed for testing.
    ```


3.  **Write tests:**

    -   Place tests in the `specs` directory.
    -   Follow the page object model structure for consistency.
    -   Use fixtures to manage test data.
  
4.  **Run tests:**

    ```
    npx playwright test
    ```

    You can also run tests in headed mode (with a visible browser):

    Bash

    ```
    npx playwright test --headed

    ```

5.  **View test report:**

    -   After running tests, Playwright generates a report in HTML format.

Configuration
-------------

-   **playwright.config.ts:** Modify this file to customize your test environment, set browser options, and configure other settings.
-   **fixtures:** Store your test fixtures here.
-   **page:** Store your page objects here.

GitHub Actions
--------------

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests on pull requests. Check the `.github/workflows` directory for details on the workflow configuration.

Best Practices
--------------

-   **Keep tests focused:** Test one specific feature or user flow per test.
-   **Name tests descriptively:** Use clear, meaningful names for your test cases.
-   **Use assertions wisely:** Make sure your tests verify the expected outcomes.
-   **Regularly update tests:** As the website evolves, keep your tests up-to-date.
